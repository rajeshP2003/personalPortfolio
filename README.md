To create a personal portfolio page, you need to be proficient in HTML5 and CSS3. In this project, you will create a web page containing the standard information for a work portfolio, including your name and image, projects, niche skills, and interests. If you want, you can also add your CV and host the complete portfolio on GitHub via your GitHub account. 

The portfolio page should have a header and footer section. The header section will include a menu highlighting your personal information, contact information, and work. You can place your photo at the top part of the page and include a short description of your professional career and interests. Below this description, you can add a few work samples. The footer section can contain your social media handles.
